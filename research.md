    <p>
   At de.ci.phe.red LAB, we look forward to working in various domains of cybersecurity. Our very recent and current research mainly focusses on Cryptanalysis, RFI Tag and RFID Protocol Security, Embedded Device Security and reverse engineering. Our projects are both theoretical and applied in nature. We are not only producing stand-alone research articles but are also involved with other academic institutes viz. IIT Delhi and IIT Madras. Through these collaborations, we have widened our scope of research to security analysis of some of the upcoming technologies in India (the PAN-India 5G Testbed framework and RFID Security).
